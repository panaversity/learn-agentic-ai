# Prompt Architect: Prompt-First Agent Development (PFAD)

## 🏷️ Official Name (Coined Right Here):

> ### 🚀 **Prompt-First Agent Development (PFAD)**  
> *A methodology where developers architect, build, test, and deploy software — especially AI agents — by engineering prompts for AI-powered tools like Cursor or ChatGPT 5 Codex, rather than writing code manually.*

You are a **Prompt Architect**.  
Cursor is your **AI Compiler**.  
The OpenAI Agents SDK is your **Runtime**.

---

### 1. **Prompt Engineering for Code Generation**
You engineered precise natural language instructions (prompts) to get [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) (powered by LLMs like Claude 41.) or [ChatGPT 5 Codex(https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/)] to generate, modify, and explain code — without writing it yourself.

> 🎯 Example:  
> *“Generate an agent with SQLite memory that remembers user’s name.”*  
> → Cursor writes the Python code.

---

### 2. **Cursor-First Development**
You will use **Cursor IDE** as your primary interface — treating it not as a text editor, but as an **AI pair programmer you command via prompts**.

Cursor or Codex ChatGPT 5 isn’t just “VS Code with AI.” It’s a **prompt-to-code execution environment**.

---

### 3. **Declarative Programming via Natural Language**
Instead of writing imperative code (`for`, `if`, `def`), you declared **what you want** — and the AI generated **how to do it**.

This is similar in spirit to:
- Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform: “declare what you want”)
- SQL (“what data”, not “how to loop”)
- SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose (“what UI”, not “how to draw pixels”)

But now: **“What agent behavior”, not “how to code the class.”**

---

### 4. **Agent-Oriented Prompt Design**
You didn’t just generate snippets — you designed **AI agents** (via the OpenAI Agents SDK) using layered prompts:
- Personality → via system prompt
- Memory → via SQLite config
- Tools → via tool registration
- Safety → via guardrail prompts

This is **meta-engineering**: you engineered the engineer (the AI agent) using prompts.

## ❌ “Vide Coding” — Not a Thing

There’s no such concept as “vide coding” in:
- Computer science literature
- AI/ML research
- Software engineering methodologies
- Cursor’s documentation or marketing

- **“Vibe coding”** — a slang term sometimes used to describe coding based on intuition, flow state, or “just feeling it.” But even that doesn’t apply here — you are being *highly intentional* with prompt design.
- **“No-code” or “Low-code”** — but this is *prompt-code*, which is different: you’re still producing full, deployable, complex code — just not typing it.
- **“AI coding” or “LLM-assisted dev”** — yes, this fits.

## 💡 Why This Matters

You’re not replacing coding — you’re **elevating it**.

Instead of:
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    return income * 0.2
```

You’re writing:
> “Create a tax agent that calculates federal tax using 2024 US brackets, remembers user’s last income, and explains the calculation in plain English.”

The AI writes the 200-line implementation.  
You designed the behavior, constraints, memory, and UX — in one sentence.

That’s **higher-order engineering**.
