# Executive Summary — Summer 2025: The AI-First Turning Point (and How to Harness It)

Summer 2025 is a structural break in software development. Frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-5 class systems, Claude 4.1x, Gemini 2.5+), AI-first IDEs (Cursor), and production-grade development agents have transformed coding from “manual by default” to **AI-assisted by default**. Adoption is mainstream; capability milestones are public; enterprises are reorganizing around agents. The new risk isn’t *whether* to use AI—it’s *how*. Teams that “vibe code” (loose, ad-hoc prompting) ship fast but brittle. Teams that apply **Prompt-Driven Development (PDD)**—small, spec-guided prompt increments—paired with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**, and **PR (Pull Request) gates** ship fast **and** durable. In short: keep the creative spark, **but with a suit on**.

## What This Series Delivers

* **Method, not folklore.** A paste-ready workflow for **PDD × TDD** (Plan → Red → Green → Refactor → Explain → Record → PR) so the AI does the typing while your prompts define *what right looks like*.
* **Governance you’ll actually use.** Lightweight **ADRs** to record “why,” a **PR policy** (“no green, no merge”), coverage targets, contract tests, and tracing—turning velocity into maintainability.
* **Operator’s handbook.** Repo-ready prompt templates (architect, tests-only, minimal-diff, refactor, ADR, PR), uv/Docker patterns, and CI checklists that scale from solo to enterprise.

## Setting Up AI-Enhanced Dev Environments: **Dual Setup PDD**

To make PDD practical day-to-day, we recommend a **dual environment** for Python Agentic projects:

### VS Code + GPT-5 Codex (Agentic, Cloud-First)

* **What it is:** A coding-optimized GPT-5 agent (often called **GPT-5-Codex**) that executes multi-file, parallel tasks via ChatGPT/CLI/extension.
* **Best at:** Large refactors, cross-repo edits, autonomous chores (tests/docs), PR prep/review.
* **Trade-offs:** Cloud-latency for small tweaks; interactive “inline” edits depend on extension support.

### Standalone Cursor (AI-First IDE, Editor-Centric)

* **What it is:** A VS Code–derived IDE with native AI **tab completion** and repo-aware chat/composer.
* **Best at:** Rapid, in-editor iteration, predictive multi-line edits, “flow-state” coding and local refactors.
* **Trade-offs:** You still review diffs; massive, fully autonomous changes are better delegated to an agent.

#### Similarities (Why both shine)

* Modern LLMs for generation, edits, and debugging; multi-file awareness; codebase chat; measurable time savings when paired with good prompts and tests.

#### Differences (Why you want both)

| Aspect      | Cursor (Editor-centric)                                     | GPT-5-Codex (Agent-centric)                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Interaction | Inline/tab completion; real-time previews                   | Natural-language tasks; parallel autonomous runs      |
| Sweet spot  | Quick edits, tight loops, local refactors                   | Repo-wide changes, scaffolding, PRs/tests/docs        |
| Ecosystem   | Feels like VS Code; supports models from multiple providers | Deep OpenAI integration; strongest in agent workflows |

**Bottom line:** Use **GPT-5-Codex in VS Code** to *initiate projects, run broad refactors, and prepare PRs*, then **Cursor** to *iterate quickly with inline edits and predictive suggestions*. Git-sync lets you hop between them seamlessly—Swiss-army knife + laser scalpel.

## How We’ll Apply PDD × TDD in the Tutorials

* **Baby steps by prompt.** Each lesson starts with an *architect prompt* (micro-spec), adds **Red** tests, goes **Green** with the smallest diff, refactors safely, explains changes, records an **ADR**, and opens a **PR**.
* **Guardrails by default.** Pydantic output shapes, error taxonomies, and contract tests prevent regressions and keep agentic edits on the rails.
* **Evidence over anecdotes.** You’ll measure lead time, coverage, change-fail rate, and MTTR as you adopt AI-first practices.


## Why This Matters

The winners of 2025 aren’t just “using AI”; they’re **professionalizing** it. PDD gives you repeatability; TDD turns intent into executable checks; ADRs make choices explainable; PR gates make quality social and auditable. Adopt all four and you’ll move faster—with fewer 3 a.m. rollbacks and more 3 p.m. launches.

**Call to action:** Open the first tutorial. Paste the prompts. Let the AI type. You conduct.
