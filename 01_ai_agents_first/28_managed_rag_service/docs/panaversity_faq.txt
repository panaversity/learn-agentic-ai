Panaversity Program FAQ

Q: What is the goal of the Panaversity Agentic AI course?
A: To help students learn how to build helpful AI agents with Python, deploy them, and keep them safe.

Q: How much time should I spend each week?
A: Plan for five to seven focused hours. Short daily practice beats a long weekend cram.

Q: Do I need a paid OpenAI plan?
A: A paid plan is useful for steady access, but you can follow along with a free trial as long as you watch your usage.

Q: What if an API call fails because of missing credits?
A: The agent will point it out. Add more credits or switch to a smaller model like `gpt-4o-mini`.

Q: How do I keep my API key safe?
A: Store it in your `.env` file locally and as a secret in any cloud host. Never paste it in public repos or screenshots.

Q: Can I use these lessons with other LLM providers?
A: Yes. The ideas are portable. You will just swap the SDK and update the config files.
