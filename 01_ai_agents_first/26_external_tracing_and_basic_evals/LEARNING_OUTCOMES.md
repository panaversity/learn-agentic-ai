# Learning Outcomes: Agent Evaluation Mastery

After completing **26_basic_evaluating_agents**, you will master **evaluation and observability** - the critical missing piece for production AI agents.

> **Important Context**:
>
> - ✅ You already learned agent building (lessons 01-25)
> - 🎯 This lesson adds **evaluation skills** - how to prove agents work, monitor them, and improve them systematically
> - 💡 Think: "I built it" → "I can prove it works and optimize it"

## 🎯 The Core Skill Gap This Fills

**You already know** (from lessons 1-25): Build agents, add tools, handle handoffs, manage memory

**You'll NOW learn** (lesson 26): Evaluate, monitor, test, debug, and optimize those agents in production

- Compare performance metrics side-by-side
- Make data-driven decisions about changes
- Track which optimizations actually help

**What's NEW**: Evidence-based optimization instead of gut feelings

**Real-World Value**: "This change improved accuracy by 12%" vs "I think it's better"

---

### 7. **Cost & Performance Monitoring** �⚡

You will be able to:

- Track token usage per request/user/session
- Calculate cost per interaction
- Identify expensive operations
- Monitor latency breakdowns (LLM call, tool execution, total)

**What's NEW**: Visibility into operational costs and performance

**Real-World Value**: Manage budgets, meet SLAs, optimize expensive operations.

### 8. **Evaluation Strategy Design** �

You will be able to:

- Choose between online vs offline evaluation

## 🎯 The Critical Gap This Fills

**Most AI courses teach**: How to build agents

**This lesson teaches**: How to **evaluate, monitor, and improve** agents

### Why This Matters:

- 🚨 **95% of AI projects fail** in production
- 🎯 **Reason #1**: No observability or evaluation
- ✅ **This lesson**: Gives you the missing 50% of the skill set

### You Go From:

- "I built an agent" → "I built and can **prove it works**"
- "It works for me" → "Here's the **data showing** it works"
- "I think it's good" → "Users rate it **4.5/5** and it costs **$0.03/request**"
