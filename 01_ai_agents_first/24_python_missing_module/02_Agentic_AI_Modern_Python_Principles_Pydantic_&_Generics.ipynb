        "Python 3.12 introduced several improvements to generics, making them more powerful and easier to use. This tutorial covers everything you need to know about generics in Python 3.12, with clear examples and practical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generics in Python 3.12 are part of the type hinting system, which has evolved significantly since Python 3.5 introduced type annotations via PEP 484. Generics allow developers to write reusable, type-safe code by defining classes, functions, or data structures that can operate on different types while maintaining static type checking. With Python 3.12, generics have been refined with improvements in syntax and runtime behavior, building on earlier enhancements like those in PEP 695 (introduced in Python 3.12). Let’s break this down in depth.\n",

        "## **1. What Are Generics?** <a name=\"what-are-generics\"></a>\n",
        "\n",
        "Generics enable you to parameterize types, meaning you can create a blueprint for a class or function that works with any type (or a constrained set of types) specified by the user of that code. For example, a generic List can hold integers, strings, or custom objects, and the type checker ensures consistency without needing separate implementations for each type.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, generics are primarily used with the typing module (e.g., List, Dict, Optional) and, starting with Python 3.12, with new syntax from PEP 695, such as type statements and TypeVar refinements. They don’t change runtime behavior directly—Python remains dynamically typed—but they enhance static analysis tools like mypy, pyright, or IDEs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. Why Are Generics Needed?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Code Reusability**: Without generics, you’d need to write duplicate code for different types. For instance, a function to process a list of integers and a list of strings would require two separate implementations. Generics let you write one function that works for any type.\n",
        "2.  **Type Safety**: Generics allow static type checkers to catch errors before runtime. For example, if a function expects a List[int] but receives a List[str], the type checker flags it.\n",
        "3.  **Abstraction**: They enable abstract data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, or trees) that can work with any data type, making libraries more flexible and maintainable.\n",
        "4.  **Interoperability**: Modern Python codebases often integrate with typed libraries or frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Pydantic). Generics ensure compatibility and clarity in such ecosystems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. How Do Generics Work in Python 3.12?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python 3.12 introduces a cleaner syntax for generics via PEP 695, reducing reliance on the typing module’s older constructs. Here’s how they’re implemented:"
