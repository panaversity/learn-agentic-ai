‚ÄúProject NANDA‚Äù refers to **Networked Agents And Decentralized AI**‚Äîan ambitious initiative developed at MIT that‚Äôs essentially building the ‚ÄúInternet for AI agents.‚Äù 

As we move from single chatbots to **ecosystems of AI agents**, we need common ways for agents to *find*, *trust*, and *talk to* each other across companies and clouds‚Äîotherwise every integration is a bespoke blind date with awkward small talk. **Project NANDA** (MIT) proposes the ‚ÄúInternet of AI Agents‚Äù: a discovery-and-trust fabric so agents can be located, identified, verified, and routed like services on the web. Think ‚ÄúDNS + PKI + smart routing,‚Äù but for agents that collaborate and transact, not just serve static pages‚Äîyes, it‚Äôs DNS with espresso.

A key technical piece is the **NANDA Index** backed by **Verified AgentFacts**‚Äîcryptographically signed metadata about an agent‚Äôs identity, capabilities, endpoints, and policies. The Index gives **fast resolution**, **key rotation**, **privacy-preserving queries**, and **schema-validated capability assertions** (say that three times fast). It‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond DNS‚Äù because it resolves to verifiable, dynamic facts rather than just IPs. 

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what that entails and why it matters:

## What Is Project NANDA?

**NANDA** ( Networked Agents And Decentralized AI ) is a decentralized system that enables AI Agents to securely Discover,  verify , communicate and collaborate with other AI Agents across different diverse platforms and protocols.

It provides a unified system for independent AI agents to securely discover, verify, communicate, and collaborate across different platforms and networks. Instead of developers creating custom, one-off integrations for each AI, NANDA provides a shared infrastructure, allowing agents to work together seamlessly.

* It leverages standards like Anthropic‚Äôs MCP (Model Context Protocol) and Google‚Äôs A2A (Agent-to-Agent), bringing them together into one unified, decentralized network.([nanda.media.mit.edu][1], [numorpho.org][2], [LinkedIn][3])
* Project NANDA lays the foundation for an **‚ÄòInternet of AI Agents‚Äô**, enabling agents from individuals, businesses, and institutions to interact, transact, and grow within a connected, federated ecosystem.([LinkedIn][3], [Forbes][4], [numorpho.org][2])

---

## Why It Matters

NANDA matters because it provides the missing layer of **Trust** and **interoperability** for the growing world of AI agents.It creates the backbone they need to interact securely, seamlessly, and scalably.

* Think of it as the TCP/IP + DNS + SSL for agents: the basic plumbing that makes large-scale, secure collaboration possible.
* NANDA acts as a universal adapter, enabling agents built on different frameworks to communicate and collaborate without requiring the same protocol.([LinkedIn][5], [Forbes][4])
* NANDA provides a **decentralized registry**, similar to domain name resolution, that allows agents to reliably discover each other across a shared network.([Forbes][4], [LinkedIn][3], [Medium][6], [Wikipedia][7])
* NANDA adds **secure identity**, **trust**, and **verification layers**, making every interaction verifiable, reliable, and protected against impersonation([Medium][6], [arXiv][8], [LinkedIn][3])

## Core Components & Innovations

### 1. **Agent Discovery & Registry**

Agents can locate and communicate with other agents through a federated registry‚Äîthink of it as NANDA‚Äôs version of DNS for agent identities.([nanda.media.mit.edu][1], [numorpho.org][2], [Medium][6], [arXiv][9])

### 2. **Identity, Trust & Accountability**

Agents have cryptographic identities, signing every interaction to ensure accountability and establish trust.([Medium][6], [numorpho.org][2], [arXiv][8])

### 3. **Protocol Interoperability**

NANDA doesn‚Äôt replace existing protocols‚Äîit wraps around them, enabling cross-protocol interoperability (MCP, A2A, HTTPS, NLWeb) through a modular ‚Äúquilt‚Äù structure.([nanda.media.mit.edu][1], [numorpho.org][2], [LinkedIn][3], [Medium][6], [Forbes][4], [velocityascent.com][10])

### 4. **Economic & Incentive Systems**

The architecture includes vision for economic layers‚Äîagents can be rewarded for useful actions via tokens, credits, or traceable contributions.([Medium][6], [numorpho.org][2], [velocityascent.com][10])

### 5. **Adaptive Resolver**

NANDA is extending its registry with dynamic resolution: agents can choose communication endpoints based on regional load, context, or security, the way an intelligent routing layer might.([arXiv][11])

### 6. **Scoping & Architecture Phases**

Project NANDA is rolling out in phases:

* **Phase 1: Agentic Web Foundations** (agent discovery, communication, security)
* **Phase 2: Agentic Commerce** (economic and marketplace features)
* **Phase 3: Society of Agents** (collaborative networks and emergent behaviors)([LinkedIn][12])

### 7. **Enterprise & Research Applications**

A recent paper outlines NANDA‚Äôs framework for secure, interoperable multi-agent systems that support discovery, credential verification, and cross-protocol security in enterprise environments.([arXiv][8])
Additional research explores registry models, metadata standards like AgentFacts, and trust mechanisms across protocols.([arXiv][9])

## How NANDA Relates to MCP/A2A

Great question. Project **NANDA** doesn‚Äôt compete with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** or **A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol from Google)** ‚Äî instead it‚Äôs designed as the **interoperability and discovery layer that stitches them together**.

Here‚Äôs how the pieces fit:

---

## üîó NANDA vs MCP vs A2A

| Layer                            | Purpose                                                                                                           | Where NANDA Fits                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Standardizes how LLMs/agents talk to external tools, data sources, and extensions. It‚Äôs ‚Äúagent ‚Üî tools.‚Äù          | NANDA treats MCP agents as *nodes* on its network. It provides a registry, identity, and trust system so MCP agents can be found, verified, and securely connected across domains.          |
| **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**         | Google‚Äôs emerging protocol for agent ‚Üî agent conversations (structured messages, negotiation, and orchestration). | NANDA allows A2A agents to interoperate with MCP agents (and others) by acting as a **bridge layer**. It doesn‚Äôt replace A2A‚Äîit lets A2A traffic flow securely across different ecosystems. |
| **NANDA**                        | Network infrastructure: discovery, identity, trust, cross-protocol routing (like TCP/IP + DNS for agents).        | Provides a universal addressing system and registry so MCP and A2A agents can *find each other*, authenticate, and talk‚Äîregardless of protocol differences.                                 |

## üåç How They Work Together

1. **Discovery & Registry**

   * NANDA provides a DNS-like service so that MCP agents, A2A agents, or any other protocol participants can be discovered with metadata (capabilities, trust level, ownership).
   * Example: An A2A scheduling agent can query NANDA to find an MCP-based calendar agent.

2. **Identity & Trust**

   * Every agent has a cryptographic identity in NANDA.
   * Whether the agent speaks MCP or A2A, NANDA signs and verifies messages, preventing impersonation.

3. **Protocol Interoperability**

   * MCP focuses on ‚Äúagent ‚Üî tool,‚Äù while A2A focuses on ‚Äúagent ‚Üî agent.‚Äù
   * NANDA acts like a **router/adapter** so these protocols can coexist and interoperate instead of fragmenting.

4. **Dynamic Resolution**

   * NANDA can route conversations intelligently: e.g., a request from an A2A agent may be routed through an MCP extension if that‚Äôs the only available capability.

---

## üìå Analogy

* **MCP** = USB protocol (plug tools into agents).
* **A2A** = Bluetooth protocol (agents talking directly).
* **NANDA** = The Internet stack (DNS + TCP/IP) that ensures both USB and Bluetooth devices can be *found, identified, and connected* across networks.

---

üëâ In short: **MCP and A2A handle the *content and structure* of communication. NANDA handles the *infrastructure, discovery, and interoperability*.**

## NANDA √ó MCP √ó A2A ‚Äî one-page crib sheet (the ‚ÄúUSB-C, Bluetooth & Internet‚Äù of agents)

**TL;DR**

* **MCP** = agents ‚Üî tools (think *USB-C for capabilities*); **A2A** = agent ‚Üî agent (think *Bluetooth for negotiations*); **NANDA** = discovery, identity, trust, routing (think *DNS/PKI + roads*). If MCP and A2A are the band, NANDA is the stage, lights, and the bouncer with the guest list. ([Anthropic][1], [modelcontextprotocol.io][2], [NANDA][3])

**What NANDA is (and why you care)**

* MIT‚Äôs **Project NANDA** (‚ÄúNetworked Agents & Decentralized AI‚Äù) aims to build the open **Internet of AI Agents**: a federated **Index** that resolves agent IDs to **Verified AgentFacts** (identity, capabilities, endpoints, policy) with cryptographic guarantees and fast revocation‚Äîbasically *DNS with superpowers and fewer SPF headaches*. ([NANDA][3], [ar5iv][4])

**How NANDA relates to MCP & A2A**

* **NANDA** is the fabric: *find ‚Üí verify ‚Üí route*. **MCP** standardizes tool access so agents call actions safely. **A2A** standardizes inter-agent collaboration and task lifecycles. Together they prevent protocol silos‚Äîlike adapters that finally fit without duct tape. ([modelcontextprotocol.io][2], [Anthropic][5], [Google Developers Blog][6], [Linux Foundation][7])

**Core artifacts (mental models)**

* **NANDA Index & Verified AgentFacts**: signed metadata enabling discovery, least-disclosure queries, multi-endpoint routing, and sub-second key rotation‚Äîyour agents get passports, not sticky notes. ([ar5iv][4])
* **MCP Tools**: schema-described actions/resources exposed by servers and invoked by clients‚Äîfinally, one plug that isn‚Äôt proprietary triangle-shaped. ([Anthropic][1], [modelcontextprotocol.io][2])
* **A2A Agent Cards & Tasks**: capability ads + structured, multi-modal exchanges over web transports‚Äîbasically LinkedIn + Trello for bots (minus humble-bragging). ([Google Developers Blog][6], [Google Codelabs][8])

**Reference flow (concept-only)**

1. **Discover**: Client asks NANDA for ‚Äúwho can `calendar.schedule`?‚Äù (no more yelling into the void).
2. **Verify & Resolve**: NANDA returns **AgentFacts** + endpoints (IDs checked, fake moustaches removed).
3. **Negotiate**: Agents coordinate via **A2A** (who does what, when, with which artifacts).
4. **Execute**: The doer calls **MCP** tools to act (sharp knives, safe kitchen). 

**Security & governance (why CISOs sleep)**

* Crypto identities, signed facts, privacy-preserving discovery; A2A now under **Linux Foundation** for neutral stewardship‚Äîopen standards that age like wine, not milk. ([Linux Foundation][7], [Google Developers Blog][9])

**When to use what (quick rules)**

* Ask ‚Äú*Who can I trust to do X?*‚Äù ‚Üí **NANDA**; ‚Äú*How to perform X on systems?*‚Äù ‚Üí **MCP**; ‚Äú*Which agent will do X and how do we coordinate?*‚Äù ‚Üí **A2A**‚Äîlike picking shoes: boots (NANDA), cleats (MCP), dance shoes (A2A). ([Anthropic][1], [Google Developers Blog][6])

**Design tips (interop without tears)**

* Use shared **capability names** (e.g., `calendar.schedule`), keep **AgentFacts** small and signed, prefer **least-disclosure** queries, and let NANDA bridge protocols‚Äîmore jazz ensemble, less drum solo. ([ar5iv][4])

**Pointers to the canonical stuff**

* **NANDA**: MIT site + **NANDA Index & Verified AgentFacts** paper (‚ÄúBeyond DNS‚Äù). ([NANDA][3], [ar5iv][4])
* **MCP**: official docs + current spec. ([Anthropic][1], [modelcontextprotocol.io][2])
* **A2A**: Google‚Äôs announcement + Linux Foundation project updates. (Yes, the grown-ups are in the room.) ([Google Developers Blog][6], [Linux Foundation][7])

## NANDA‚Äôs conceptual building blocks

1. **Index & Resolution**: A quilt-like, federated **Index** that resolves agent identifiers to **Verified AgentFacts**; supports rapid spin-up, revocation, and multi-endpoint routing‚Äîimagine DNS that also checks a driver‚Äôs license and routes around traffic. ([ar5iv][5])
2. **Verified AgentFacts**: Signed metadata with identity keys, capability claims, endpoints, and governance signals; **CRDT-style updates** keep facts consistent across replicas‚Äîmetadata with a gym membership. ([ar5iv][5])
3. **Identity & Trust**: Cryptographic identity with **capability attestation** and least-disclosure queries; aligns with **Zero-Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA)** patterns in enterprise contexts‚Äîtrust, but verify (and log), then verify again. ([arXiv][6])
4. **Cross-Protocol Interop**: One agent registry, many protocols: **MCP**, **A2A**, classic **HTTPS**, and even emerging agentic protocols‚ÄîNANDA‚Äôs the switchboard, not the call script. ([arXiv][6])

## MCP: the tool & data integration theory

**MCP** defines how LLMs/agents access **tools, resources, and context** in a uniform way‚Äîservers expose **tools** with schemas; hosts/clients invoke them; models stay protocol-agnostic. It‚Äôs the ecosystem‚Äôs **tooling spine**, so we don‚Äôt keep reinventing ‚Äúcall this API‚Äù in 37 dialects (your future self says thanks). ([modelcontextprotocol.io][3])

## A2A: the inter-agent conversation theory

**A2A** describes **capability discovery** via **Agent Cards**, **task-centric interactions** with lifecycle and artifacts, and multi-modal **message parts**, over **HTTP/SSE/JSON-RPC**‚Äîso agents can negotiate and collaborate like teammates, not like fax machines. The project is now under **Linux Foundation governance**, which signals multi-vendor neutrality and longevity‚Äîopen standards don‚Äôt age like dairy. ([Google Developers Blog][4], [Linux Foundation][7])

## The layered conceptual model (who stands where)

* **Experience layer**: UIs, human-in-the-loop, workflows (because users still exist, promise).
* **Agent layer (A2A)**: Agents discover capabilities, negotiate tasks, and exchange context‚Äîinterviews, not monologues. ([Google Developers Blog][4])
* **Tooling layer (MCP)**: Agents invoke structured tools/data with stable schemas‚Äîless spaghetti, more rigatoni. ([modelcontextprotocol.io][3])
* **Fabric layer (NANDA)**: Discovery, identity, registry, trust, and cross-protocol routing‚Äîlike a switchboard that also checks passports. ([MIT Media Lab][2], [ar5iv][5])

## End-to-end reference flow

1. **Discover**: A2A client needs ‚Äúcalendar.schedule‚Äù; it queries the **NANDA Index** for agents with matching **AgentFacts** (capability + policy). No left swipes needed. ([ar5iv][5])
2. **Verify & Resolve**: Index returns **verified facts** with cryptographic identity and endpoints; client picks a route (region, load, policy). GPS for agents, minus toll roads. ([ar5iv][5])
3. **Negotiate**: Over **A2A**, agents agree on task scope, modalities, and artifacts (the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù). It‚Äôs a project kickoff, not a mystery novel. ([Google Developers Blog][4])
4. **Execute**: The actor agent uses **MCP tools** to perform actions (e.g., create an event) with schemas and guardrails‚Äîsharp knives in a safe kitchen. ([modelcontextprotocol.io][3])
5. **Audit & Govern**: Policies, signatures, and logs satisfy enterprise governance (ZTAA/AVC patterns), while keeping autonomy and privacy‚Äîcompliance that doesn‚Äôt kill the party. ([arXiv][6])


## Open questions (worth debating over ‚òï)

* **Capability semantics**: How universal can capability names be across domains without becoming mush? (The ‚Äúcalendar.schedule‚Äù of today becomes ‚Äúworkflow\.compose‚Äù tomorrow.)
* **Registry federation**: How many indexes, how are they delegated, and who sets revocation norms? (DNS taught us politics hides in TXT records.) ([ar5iv][5])
* **Policy portability**: Can privacy/compliance policies travel with AgentFacts across org boundaries, or do we keep reinventing NDAs? (The legal bots want in.)
* **Adoption gravity**: Will MCP‚Äôs momentum or A2A‚Äôs enterprise focus dominate first‚Äîor will NANDA‚Äôs discovery layer make that rivalry less zero-sum? (History loves a good protocol drama.) ([modelcontextprotocol.io][3], [Google Developers Blog][4])

---

### TL;DR

* **NANDA** = the **fabric** (discovery, identity, trust, routing).
* **MCP** = the **tools/data** protocol.
* **A2A** = the **agent-to-agent** protocol.
  Used together, they enable **discoverable, trustworthy, interoperable** agent ecosystems‚Äîfinally, agents that can find each other, prove who they are, and get stuff done without sticky notes.
